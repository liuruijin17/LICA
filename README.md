**LICA**: A Lightweight Lane Shape Detector with Curvature-Aware Learning
=======

* âš¡âš¡ Super lightweight: The number of model parameters is only 267,867.
* âš¡âš¡ Super low complexity: The number of MACs (1 MAC = 2 FLOP) is only 486.617M.
* ðŸ˜Ž  Learning sturctures with large curvatures without expensive, dense, and precise human annotations.
